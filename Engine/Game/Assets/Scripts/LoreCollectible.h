       "Months of tests, and we have begun using the energy to heal living cells. The results are astonishing. We have even been able to cure diseases. The energy potential seems limitless, but we must be careful.",
       "Side effects are emerging. Prolonged exposure to the energy is causing a symbiosis between machinery and living tissue. Hosts grow pale and start to mutate.The machines too act erratically and wont shut down unless we cut their power source. Something is wrong.",
       "Today, the core of the planet,what we now call Chrysalite, shook violently. The excessive extraction triggered a massive earthquake, damaging the facility and security systems. We have lost control of the situation.",
