## Engine Guide

- Camera
  - Hold Right-Click and use “WASD” for a fps-like movement and free look around must be enabled.

  - Use the mouse Wheel for zooming in and out.
  - Left ALT + Left Click to Rotate de center of the scene.
  - Holding SHIFT duplicates de movement speed.
- Project Panel

  **All model files (.gltf, .bin, textures...) should always be in the same folder**.
  - Dragging an asset inside the scene should create a GameObject in the Hierarchy panel with an meshRenderer component.
- Hierarchy Panel  
  - Right click in hierarchy panel will open a popup where you can create, duplicate and delete a gameobject.
  - Dragging a GameObject into another GameObjet will set it as the child of the second object.
- Inspector Panel
  - Click Button "Add Component" in the inspector panel when a gameObject is selected to add a new component.
  - Every gameObject has a transform tha can be modified using the transform section in the inspector panel.
  - The name of a gameObject can be modified in the inspector panel.

  - W to move object.
  - E to Rotate object.
  - R to scale object.
